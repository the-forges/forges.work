# The Forges

As an apprenticeship guided, worker's cooperative union hall, we are seeking to build an alternative to boot camps, temp jobs, and unstable contract work.

Our main goals are to provide:

- Paid apprenticeships where you learn the skills you need on the job with mentors that will help launch your career into future roles that fit you best
- Education for various kinds of tech work
- Worker's democracy and a place where you are part and parcel of the decision process at every level
- A living wage from the start
- Health benefits that are the closest thing to Medicare that we can get
- Comrades to have your back
